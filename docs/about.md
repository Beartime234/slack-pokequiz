Think my questions suck? Why don't you submit your own! You can submit
your own questions by visiting the [slack-quizdata](https://github.com/Beartime234/slack-quizdata) github repo and raising
a pull request. There are instructions on how to a do this in that repository under docs.

## {{ site.quiz_name }} Open Source

As of this time the code for the {{ site.quiz_name }} itself is not open sourced.
Mostly due to the fact it's a little bit of a hack job right now. I hope to release it
ASAP. When I do I will update this.
